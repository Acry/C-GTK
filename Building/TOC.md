# Building GTK-Programs


The build-process combines all steps to make your program executable.

I describe a few here, pick the one which fits to your needs.

[POSIX-Shell](./POSIX-Shell/Shell.md) [GNU-Make](./Make/Make.md) [CMake](./CMake/CMake.md) [Meson](./Meson/Meson.md)

Now, you are hopefully able to execute the code and can move on to a topic of your interest.
